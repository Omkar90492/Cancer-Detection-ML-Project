# 🧬 Cancer Detection ML

A machine-learning project that predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using clinical measurement features.

This repository includes:
- Data preprocessing with SMOTE
- Training of **Random Forest**, **SVC**, and **XGBoost**
- Evaluation reports (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Saved models in `.pkl` format for future use
