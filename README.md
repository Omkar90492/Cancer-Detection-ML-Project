# 🧬 Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

A robust machine learning project that uses medical data to predict the likelihood of cancer. This project leverages three powerful classification models — **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVC)**, and **XGBoost** — trained on real-world data to help in early cancer diagnosis.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Early detection of cancer can dramatically improve treatment outcomes. This project applies machine learning to medical datasets to classify instances as cancerous or non-cancerous. It supports model training, prediction, and can be easily extended with visualization or a user interface.

## 📊 Dataset

- Format: CSV (`data.csv`)
- Contains various medical features used in diagnosis, such as:
  - Mean radius
  - Texture
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Smoothness
- Label column indicates diagnosis (Malignant or Benign)

## 🧠 Models Used

This project includes three pre-trained models for prediction:

| Model            | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Random Forest    | Ensemble-based model great for generalization    |
| SVC              | Powerful linear classifier for high-dim features |
| XGBoost          | Gradient boosting model for high accuracy        |

All models are trained, saved as `.pkl` files, and ready for inference.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-detection-ml.git
cd cancer-detection-ml
2. Install Required Libraries
If a requirements.txt is provided:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost numpy
▶️ Running the Project
Ensure all files (.pkl, .csv, .py) are in the same directory, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cancer_detection.py
Modify the script to change models or test with new data.

📈 Model Performance (Suggested Metrics)
You can evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC (for binary classification)

Tip: Add sklearn.metrics and matplotlib to visualize these metrics.

🌐 Future Enhancements
🔌 Web interface using Streamlit or Flask

📊 Live visualization of predictions

🔄 Upload custom CSV files for prediction

🧪 Retrain models with new datasets

💾 Add database support for patient history
