Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of breast cancer. It classifies tumors as either Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on various features extracted from cell images. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, training multiple classification algorithms, and evaluating their performance.

Dataset
The 

data.csv file contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. Key attributes include:

id: Unique sample identifier.

diagnosis: The target variable, indicating Malignant (M) or Benign (B) status.

Various numerical features describing cell nuclei characteristics (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension, along with their standard errors and "worst" values).

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

seaborn & matplotlib: For data visualization.

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVC) and model selection (GridSearchCV).

xgboost: For gradient boosting classification.

imblearn (imbalanced-learn): For handling imbalanced datasets with SMOTE.

Setup and Run
To get this project running on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-detection.git
cd cancer-detection
Place the data.csv file directly into the cancer-detection project directory.

Execution
Run the main script to train and evaluate the models:

Bash

python cancer_detection.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the data.

Balance the dataset using SMOTE.

Train Random Forest, SVC, and XGBoost models.

Print their accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Save the trained models as .pkl files (e.g., RandomForest.pkl).

(Note: Actual metrics may vary slightly due to random state in data splitting and model training.)

Future Scope
Implement additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Neural Networks).

Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques.

Integrate cross-validation strategies beyond GridSearchCV's internal folds for more robust evaluation.

Build a user interface or web application for real-time predictions.

Deploy the best-performing model as an API.
