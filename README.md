# ðŸ§¬ Cancer Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on clinical data. It supports multiple trained models: **Random Forest**, **SVC**, and **XGBoost**.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-detection-ml.git
cd cancer-detection-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
python cancer_detection.py
âœ… Trains models using data.csv, handles imbalance with SMOTE, and saves models as .pkl files.

ðŸ§  Models Included
RandomForest.pkl

SVC.pkl

XGBoost.pkl

All models are trained and saved for future use.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Input: Numerical features from medical imaging (e.g., radius, texture)

Target: diagnosis (0 = Benign, 1 = Malignant)

Balanced using SMOTE

ðŸ“ˆ Outputs
Model accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1)

ðŸ”® Predict with a Saved Model
python
Copy
Edit
import pickle
model = pickle.load(open("RandomForest.pkl", "rb"))
prediction = model.predict([your_input_data])
âœ¨ Future Ideas
